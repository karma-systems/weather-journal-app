# Work Done

## HTML and CSS Files

I've slightly changed the HTML file, the CSS file has been replaced with another one:
>
1. One button for API data fetching.
2. One selection input to select country code.
3. Finally City name, temperature, pressure, and humidity data are fetched.
3. Adding all data together then updating the user interface accordingly.

The CSS file has been completely  replaced.

2. Fetching API data from OpenWeatherMap.com.
2. Sending all data to server-side.
